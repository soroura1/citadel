# ★ PROVE THE HOST IS REACHABLE BEFORE ANY CHECK CAN BLAME THE SERVER.
#
# Every check below this line runs over ssh, so a transport failure makes the
# FIRST of them fail - and report its own confident, wrong reason.
#
# On 20 Aug a citadel deployment printed "No /opt/citadel/citadel/.env on the
# VPS - see the bootstrap checklist" while that file was present, complete and
# owned by deploy. The .env was never the problem: ssh had closed and `test -f`
# never ran. The message sent the operator to the wrong checklist entirely.
#
# ⚠️ THE TRAP THAT CAUSED IT. The Woodpecker agent runs ON the VPS, so a deploy
# step is a container on that same host - and a container cannot reliably reach
# its own host's PUBLIC address. The connection is accepted and then dropped
# ("Connection closed by <host> port 22"). The identical container reaches the
# identical sshd without incident over the docker bridge gateway. So while the
# runner lives on the box, VPS_HOST must be 172.17.0.1, NOT the public IP.
#
# A check is only worth its message. One that cannot tell "the server said no"
# from "the server was never asked" is worse than no check.

# mount, and deploy.sh had exited before `up -d --force-recreate` could fix it.
